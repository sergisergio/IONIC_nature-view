- Thanks to Cordova, we can use user's device native features such as camera and geolocation.
- Ionic Native has more than 130 native plugins (See [https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/)).

``` bash
ionic start nature-view blank
```
#### First step

- Then we generate 3 pages (single-view, new-view and set-coordinates) and we add them in our AppModule.
- We create a model for our data: each NatureView has name, date, description, coordinates and a path to its picture.
- We create a service to handle data containing a list which will be emitted as a Subject.(We add the service in AppModule).
- HomePage shows this list: so subscribe to this Subject et emit it.
- Then we create NewViewPage by using a reactive form for name, date and description.

#### Geolocation

``` bash
npm install --save @agm/core
```
- Then get a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key?hl=en#key).
- And we add AgmCoreModule in our AppModule.
- SetCoordinatesPage wil be shown in a modal by using ModalController (imported and injected in NewViewPage).
- Then we add a button "Add a site".
- Now we create SetCoordinatesPage: latitude and longitude, marker object.
- And we create the template (in oder to show the map, we need a CSS height for "agm-map").
- Now, we need to get the event from the (mapClick) in onMapClicked method.
- We pass coordinates when we close the modal and we save them only if there's a marker on map.
- In NewViewPage, look at onOpenCoordsModal(), we use the onDidDismiss() method to get the modal close and data.
- Then, to check saved data, we add an item in the template.
- We need to save coords when we go back to the map (see onOpenCoordsModal).
- Now, we need native geolocation from user's device.

``` bash
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation
npm install --save @ionic-native/geolocation
```

- We add Geolocation in our AppModule.
- Then we inject Geolocation, LoadingController, ToastController in SetCoordinates.
- And we add the geolocation button in the template.

#### Camera

``` bash
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
npm install--save @ionic-native/camera
```

- We add Camera in our AppModule.
- Then we add the button to take pictures.
- We inject Camera and ToastController in NewViewPage and we create onTakePhoto() method.
- We need to import normalizeURL from ionic-angular.
- onTakePhoto() opens our device's camera. We have to add the camera button.

*Notice*

*We cannot use the camera in our browser: we'll see that later*

- Now, user can add a location and a picture for NatureView. He needs to save it.
- We create a onSubmitForm() method by injecting NatureViewService and NavController; wee also need to import NatureView.
- Location and image are required so we add them in the template in form's conditions.
- Then we create onLoadNatureView() method.
- Finally, we create SingleViewPage to whow a natureView.

#### File and Storage

- For now, pics are stored in a temp directory. This directory could be deleted from the device when memory is full.
- The File plugin is better to save our files.

``` bash
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file
npm install --save @ionic-native/file
```

- We import File from @ionic-native/file in our AppModule and we add it in providers array.
- Then we import it in NewViewPage and its constructor.
- We modify onTakePhoto's callback to move the temp directory to a permanent directory.
- moveFile() method takes 4 arguments: path, original filename, target, target filename.

- For now, data are in a permanent directory but if we refresh our app, all data will be lost because they are only stored in a service.
- First solution: backend.
- Second solution ( we choose this option): store informations locally on the device.
- To do that, wee need the cordova-sqlite-storage plugin:

``` bash
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage
```
- (We import it in our AppModule and use its forRoot() method in imports array.).
- Then we inject Storage in NatureViewService: so this service must become "Injectable".
- And we create 2 methods: saveList() and fetchList().
- We also add this.saveList() in addNatureView().
- So, storage data are updated for each new NatureView.
- Finally, to fetch correctly storage data, we modify the ngOnInit() method in HomePage.

#### Testing our App

- ionic serve is not enough to test our app: we need to test it in a device's emulator or a real device.

**iOS (emulate)**

- we need MacOS and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) !
- Once XCode installed, we need some tools:
``` bash
xcode-select --install
```
- Then, for straight deployment on device without opening Xcode, just do that:
``` bash
npm install -g ios-deploy
```

- We need to add some lines in config.xml ( see edit-config).

- To add iOS platform to our project, execute this:
``` bash
ionic cordova platform add ios
```
- Then we build the app:
``` bash
ionic cordova build ios
```

- This build can be opened in XCode: platforms/ios and .xcodeproj.
- Create a certificate: XCode menu, settings and accounts, manage certificates button and "+" button.
- Once the certification created, we can choose it in Signing part.
- To start our app in an emulator, we just choose the device we need, then click Play.
- We could also start the app by doing:
``` bash
ionic cordova emulate ios
```

**iOS (device)**

- The best way to test the app is testing on a real device. We just need to plug and in the same menu as before, we select our device. The Play button will start our app on our device.
- Once the first start done, we can start our app on the device without XCode with:
``` bash
ionic cordova run ios
```

- We could also have more or less the same behaviour as "ionic serve" with this command:
``` bash
ionic cordova run ios --livereload
```

- The first command allows us to disconnect the device once the app is started.
- The second one forces us to let our device plugged.

See [Last Informations](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html).

**Android (emulate)**

- We need JDK ( Java Development Kit) available on [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/index.html).
- Then, we need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).
- Launch Android Studio et in Configure Menu, choose SDK Manager.
- In SDK Platforms, install API levels corresponding to android versions needed.
- We also need SDK Build-Tools and the Support Repository.
- Check the [environment variables](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html#setting-environment-variables).
- Add Andoid as platform:
- We could also have more or less the same behaviour as "ionic serve" with this command:
``` bash
ionic cordova platform add android
```
- Execute the first build:
``` bash
ionic cordova build android
```

- With Android Studio, we can now open the android directory as project (ni platforms directory of our project).
- To start an emulator, go to Tools->Android-> AVD Manager.
- Create a new device.
- Once this device created, we can start the app with Play button.

**Android (emulate)**

- Plug the device, activate USB debug and we'll see it in the window by clicking the Play button.

#### Prepare the app

***Prepare needed resources***
 - Until now, our app has default's icon and splashscreen, but we don't want that for deployment: we juist need to replace icon.png and splash.png in the resources directory.
- The icon must be exactly 1024X1024 pixels, and splash must be exactly 2732X2732 pixels (Ionic accepts PNG, PSD or AI).
- Then, for other images, we can either individually create files and replace those created by Ionic, or if we agree images for both platforms and also for all screen sizes, we can execute:
``` bash
ionic cordova resources
```
- This command generates automatically all needed versions to different platforms and screen sizes from files icon.png and splash.png.

***Set up our app***
- To configure metadata, we use config.xml. We can update id or version. Those elements are VERY important during the app's signature process. This is also there we modify name and description which will appears in the App Store or Play Store see [cordova.apache.org](https://cordova.apache.org/).

***Build our app***
- For the final build, we must check:
1. modifications in config.xml.
2. we add all needed platforms.
3. icon and splash screen updated.

- If everything's OK, build:
``` bash
ioniccordovabuild--releaseios
ioniccordovabuild--releaseandroid
```

- The release flag optimizes the app for deployment.
- Once done, we can do the signature and publish the app !

#### Publish the app

- First, we need to create an account for each platform: for iOS, a Developer Account is 99 € a year and for Google, an account is 25 € a year.

***Publish your iOS app***
- Once created the Developer Account and linked to Xcode, we can create a signature certificate.
- Then, go to [developer.apple.com](developer.apple.com): Account->certificates, Identifiers and Profiles: we'll see all our signature's certifications.
- In side menu, below identifiers, choose App IDs. We can click on an ID to update its content or click on "+" if the app doesn't exist.
- Once the certificate and the ID are created, we must go to [itunesconnect.apple.com](itunesconnect.apple.com) to create the app in the App Store.
- In My Apps, click on + icon, then fill in the form with all informations ( See [https://developer.apple.com/app-store/launch/](Apple) for deployment).
- In Xcode, we need now to do the last build to deploy the app in App Store.
- In the upper menu, choose the target "Generic iOS Device": an Archive file is created and will be loaded on App Store by choosing Archive ine the Product menu.
- Click on Upload to App Store...
- Then go back to iTunes Connect to give app's informations and to submit it for validation: if everything's ok, the app will be published on App Store.

***Publish your Android app***
- We need to sign our app to publish it on Google Play Store.
- Open the project in Android Studio and, in the build menu, choose Generate Signed APK.
- Click on Next, Android Studio allows us to choose the key store for our app's signature.
- This key store is a security. If you don't have it, select "create new" (see [developer.android.com](developer.android.com)).
- While clicking on Next, we choose the build's type (release) and the signature's version (both).
- If everything's ok, Android Studio will generate our APK.
- Our app is now ready: we can go to the Google Play Console to prepare the publication.
- We can click on "Create an application" to start a new application.
- To load our APK file, choose app's versions in the side menu, then click on "handle production" and "create a version".
- We can click on "Check" to see if everything's alright.
- Finally, click on "start deployment".
